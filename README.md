I developed a Python tool that assesses the strength of passwords based on criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. This tool also provides users with actionable feedback to enhance their password security.

Working on this project has deepened my understanding of cybersecurity and reinforced the importance of strong password practices.
